# Flames
 
Game in progress with raw(ish) OpenGL, mostly from the ground up following a class in real-time rendering.

Going for a vaguely cartoony aesthetic currently but unsure how it'll develop.

# Compilation
Requires GLEW, FreeGLUT, and GLM to compile, only tested on Windows with Visual Studio 2022

Also uses https://github.com/Bly7/OBJ-Loader/tree/master for OBJ Loading

Using OpenGL Core Profile 4.6
